The Level System is built with replayability in mind. It implements a PCG system to generate level content on the fly.

With a procedural generation system for your game's levels. In Mount Everest, these might include various environmental features, obstacles, and encounter spaces:

Base Camp: These nodes could represent temporary safe zones where the player can rest, repair equipment, manage inventory, and plan for the next stage of the climb. You might occasionally find leftover supplies or meet other climbers.

Ice Walls: These nodes would require the player to ascend vertical ice structures, possibly using special equipment and skill checks.

Crevasses: These could involve navigation puzzles, requiring the player to find a way around or over the crevasse, potentially using items like ladders or ropes.

Avalanche Zones: Dangerous areas where the player needs to traverse quickly and quietly to avoid triggering an avalanche.

Mountain Passes: These nodes would be narrow paths with high winds and limited visibility, possibly requiring the player to secure themselves with ropes to prevent being blown off the mountain.

Snow Fields: Wide-open spaces that may be deceptively dangerous due to hidden crevasses, sudden weather changes, or monster encounters.

Storm Nodes: Represent sudden weather changes or storms, forcing the player to seek shelter or risk exposure to the elements.

Monster Lair: Rare nodes that might contain a major confrontation with the Yeti or other Lovecraftian horrors, potentially offering great rewards.

Rocky Outcrops: These could involve rock climbing, with the threat of falling rocks or unstable ledges.

Serac Fields: Dangerous areas with towering blocks of ice that might collapse at any moment, requiring careful navigation.

Dead Climber Sites: Macabre reminders of the mountain's danger, potentially offering resources, lore, and occasional jump scares.

Mystical Nodes: Areas touched by the Lovecraftian horrors that might warp reality, introduce strange puzzles, or confront the player with terrifying visions.

Procedural generation works best when there's a good variety of different nodes to ensure each playthrough feels unique. Balancing the challenge and reward offered by each node type will be crucial to keep the game engaging.

Balancing involves making sure that the challenge the game presents to the player is consistently fair and satisfying. For example, if the player has a gun to scare away the Yeti, WE NEED TO balance the availability of ammunition against the frequency of Yeti encounters to ensure that the player is neither too powerless nor too powerful.

Need to figure out how a Good pacing involves carefully arranging the game's challenges, resting points, and resources to create a satisfying rhythm of tension and relief.

In terms of level convergence, the path from the BASE CAMP to the YETI LAIR should branch and re-converge in various ways, depending on the player's choices and abilities. Some branches could lead to optional challenges and rewards, while others might be easier but offer fewer resources.

Dynamic Difficulty: The game could dynamically adjust the difficulty based on the player's performance. For instance, if the player is struggling, the game could generate fewer monster encounters or provide extra resources.

Resource Management: Resources like ammunition, food, and oxygen could be strategically placed to encourage exploration and careful resource management. You could place more resources in the more difficult paths to incentivize risk-taking.

Difficulty Levels: You could offer multiple difficulty settings that affect the frequency of monster encounters, the availability of resources, and other factors.

Save Points: Strategically placed save points can ensure that players can make steady progress without becoming overly frustrated by difficult sections.

Adaptive AI: The monster's behavior could adapt based on the player's actions. For instance, if the player often uses the gun to scare away the Yeti, it could learn to be more cautious or aggressive.

Randomized Elements: By randomizing certain elements, like the placement of resources or the paths that are available, you can ensure that each playthrough is unique and unpredictable. This can add to the suspense and replayability of the game.

Only through iterative testing and tweaking can you find the right balance and pacing for your game,
that we can implement these mechanics effectively.

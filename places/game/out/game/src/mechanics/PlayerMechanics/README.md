Some mechanics are already implemented within the Roblox. For example, R15, or any characters officially supported by Roblox have inhert mechanics to them -
- Jumping Mechanics
- Movement Mechanics
- Health Mechanics
- Camera Mechanics

If you want to add, modify, or delete the built-in mechanics, you can directly create your own JumpingMechanic which disables the functionality of the built-in JumpingMechanic, which in itself a Mechanic, or modify the jumping to include custom animations or custom jumping (double jump, triple jump, etc). Or, Camera Mechanics are also built-in, defaulted to default camera mechanic where the player can zoom in and out of the camera

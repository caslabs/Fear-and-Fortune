Narraritive API allows to interact and manages the narraritive element within our games. This includes managing Cutscenes, Dialogues, and defines the Characters of the game to which can be interacted with other systems found in the game

the term "narrative engine" is one of the terms used to describe such systems in game development, especially when the focus is on branching narratives or interactive storytelling. However, the terminology might change slightly based on the context and the game's focus.

For games where the central element isn't necessarily the story but tasks, quests, or objectives, it might be referred to more specifically:

Quest System: Commonly used in RPGs and MMORPGs, where players are given quests to complete. It manages quest status, objectives, rewards, etc.

Task System: A more generic term that can encompass quests, missions, chores, or any kind of objective-based gameplay.

Dialogue System: If the narrative branching is primarily in conversations, this system manages dialogue choices and outcomes.

Story Engine: Another term similar to "narrative engine", emphasizing the unfolding story rather than the choices.

Event System: In some contexts, especially when dealing with a series of events or triggers rather than story per se.

Choice & Consequence System: In games where player choices have significant impacts on future gameplay or story outcomes.
